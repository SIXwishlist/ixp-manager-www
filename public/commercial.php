                <a href="https://www.inex.ie/">INEX</a> itself has limited resources and is not a software
                development house. But INEX are eager for IXP Manager to become the de facto
                management system for similar IXPs and as such, its staff are willing to help with
                installations so as to build better documentation.
                This is all done throught the <a href="/support">mailing list</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                We will consider feature requests - especially where they
                benefit INEX and the wider IXP community - and we certainly love feature patches!
            </p>
            <p>
                However,

                In 2016 we also lanched a <a href="/sponsorship">sponsorship program</a> to
                allow us to hire a full time devleloper on a not-for-profit basis for IXP Manager.
                If you or your organisation feels they can contribute in anyway, please contact us
                on the above address.
